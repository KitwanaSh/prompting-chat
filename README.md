This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Now that you have understood the job, we can proceed with the validation of the entire project.
I was able to solve the click issue. Now it is time for me to start with the authentication management.
Today i did not do anything because i took a flight to Adis ababa. I might think about moving on with this project after gettinng to Ghana. 

We shall have to work on this in a later time. For now, i am thinking about working in a different project.
We shall see this next time. Once again, i had a blank day. I had a little headatche or something, i don't know. But i will see how i will develop.
A week has gone. I spent too much time thinking about when and how i should continue up with this project.
